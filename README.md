# Oligo-Banding
This is the repository for all software and scripts described in (publication in progress). This publication describes a new technique to simplify and automatize karyotyping based on oligo-banding, a semi-random color barcode for chromosomes.

## Tools

* oligo banding  -> This tool is the image analyzer built as an ImageJ macro
* random banding -> This tool is used to generate a semi-random color barcode when creating the oligo probes library 
* automatic ROIs -> This tool (in developpement) is used to create regions of interest (ROIs) on the chromosomes

## TO DO

* Check if DAPI threshold follows config option
* Check if cutoff behave properly
* Check if plot is scaled properly
