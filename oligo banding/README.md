# Oligo-Banding ImageJ Macro

## Installation and requirements
The installation is simply done by copying the Oligo_Banding.ijm file into your [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/) (or [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/)) plugin folder. This pluggin is only tested with the Fiji distribution of ImageJ and ImageJ version 1.53t. You will need to install [Action Bar](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Custom_toolbars_and_mini_applications_with_Action_Bar/3397603/12) from Jerome Mutterer. This can be done by adding [IBMP-CNRS](https://sites.imagej.net/Mutterer/) update site to Fiji.
